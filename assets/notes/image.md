Dimensions:

    Recommended size: 1280 x 640 pixels (This is a common size for GitHub cover images).

2. Design Elements:

    Background: Choose a simple, professional background.
        Consider using a light blue gradient or white background with a subtle texture to keep the focus on the content.
        Alternatively, you could use a dark background with a lighter accent color (like light gray or white) to make text stand out.

    Title Text: "Exam System of Bangladesh National University"
        The font should be bold and professional (e.g., Roboto, Montserrat, or Lora).
        Text color: Dark red or Dark purple (matching your repo's branding).

    Subtitle Text: "A Study on Question Patterns in the Statistics Department"
        The subtitle should be smaller and perhaps a bit lighter in weight to distinguish it from the title.
        Use a complementary color such as white or light gray for contrast.

    Visuals/Icons:
        You could add small graph/chart icons or a calculator/pen icon to represent the field of statistics.
        Alternatively, use an image of an exam paper or something symbolic of education like a graduation cap.

    Branding:
        If you want to maintain a consistent branding, you can incorporate the color palette of your repository (e.g., Bright Red, Dark Red, Purple-Red).

    Footer/Signature:
        You can place a small logo or a symbol of Bangladesh National University (if available) at the bottom.
