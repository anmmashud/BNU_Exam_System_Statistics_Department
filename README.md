## Research Methodology

### Data Collection

- **Exam Paper Analysis**: The study analyzes the past 5 years of exam papers from the Statistics department at BNU.  
- **Interviews**: Interviews with faculty members and students will provide qualitative insights into the effectiveness of the current exam system.

### Data Analysis

- **Qualitative Analysis**: Content analysis of exam questions will be used to identify trends and patterns in question types (e.g., theoretical vs. practical).  
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Statistical analysis will compare the difficulty of exam questions and correlate these with student performance over time.

---

## Results & Discussion

### Findings

- **Trend Analysis**: Exam questions have increasingly focused on theoretical knowledge, with less emphasis on practical application.  
- **Comparison with Other Universities**: BNU's exam system tends to focus more on theory, whereas private universities like **XYZ University** emphasize practical application.

### Discussion

- **Impact on Students**: The current exam system does not adequately assess real-world application, contributing to poor student performance in practical fields.  
- **Potential Solutions**: Introducing project-based assessments and more practical questions could help bridge the gap between academic learning and industry needs.

---

## Conclusion

This study identifies significant gaps between the exam question patterns at BNU and the skills needed for professional success in the field of statistics. The research recommends revising the exam patterns to include more applied and practical questions that align with industry expectations and better prepare students for future careers.

## Future Work

Future research could focus on the following areas:
- The effectiveness of digital learning platforms in enhancing the exam system.
- Exploring alternative assessment methods such as flipped classrooms or project-based evaluations.
- Analyzing how teaching methods influence exam question patterns and student performance.
