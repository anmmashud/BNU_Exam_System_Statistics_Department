## Research Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Exam Paper Analysis**: Analyzing the past 5 years of exam papers from the Statistics department.
- **Interviews**: Conducting interviews with faculty members and students to gather insights on the exam system.

### Data Analysis
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Content analysis of exam questions to identify trends and patterns.
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Statistical analysis to compare exam difficulty and student performance over time.

---

## Results & Discussion

### Findings
- **Trend Analysis**: The exam questions have increasingly focused on theoretical knowledge, with less emphasis on practical application.
- **Comparison with Other Universities**: BNU's exam system is more theory-focused compared to private universities, which emphasize practical application.

### Discussion
- **Impact on Students**: The mismatch between exam patterns and real-world applications has contributed to poor student performance.
- **Potential Solutions**: Introducing project-based assessments or more practical questions to bridge the gap.

## Conclusion

This study found significant gaps between the exam question patterns at Bangladesh National University and the skills needed for professional success in the field of statistics. We recommend revising the question patterns to include more applied and practical questions, aligned with industry expectations.
